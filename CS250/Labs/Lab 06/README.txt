README for Spring 2017 LAB 06

You may not need to use the information about setting up your Pi contained in the Lab-6-pre-lab file.

You may see an occasional reference in the documentation to Lab 5, be assured we are working to correct these errors, and this all really is Lab 6.

Please report any errors, omissions, etc. that will help us improve these lab documents.

Thank you.
